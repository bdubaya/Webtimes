There's really nothing to it. I'm teaching myself html/js/css, and figured it was a good excuse to finally build a personal site. The idea is that having an actual project will keep me learning, and incentivize me to get work done.

If anyone sees this site, it is a constant work-in-progress. Suggestions are welcome and encouraged.
